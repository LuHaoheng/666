The project adhered to the Scrum agile framework throughout its development cycle, emphasizing iterative and incremental progress as the foundation of the process. The primary objective was to create a "Soil Moisture Monitoring and Email Notification System," and to ensure the system was both flexible and adaptive, we divided the project into multiple manageable sprints. Each sprint was centered around specific deliverables, enabling continuous improvement and adjustment based on feedback and evolving requirements.Moreover, complete agile documentation was provided, detailing each sprint, the decisions made, and how user feedback influenced the development process. A working demo was also presented to showcase the fully functional system, validating both the hardware and software integration, and confirming the success of the project within the agile framework.This version elaborates on the methodology, tools, and key processes involved, providing more context and detail to illustrate how the agile framework was applied throughout the project.
Plant Moisture Monitor with Email Notification This is a Python - based project tailored for the Raspberry Pi platform. It is designed to keep track of soil moisture levels by utilizing a GPIO - connected sensor. Additionally, it has the functionality to send out daily email reports at pre - determined times.Project Overview​​Project Type​​: Agile IoT Sensor System. This indicates that the project follows the agile development methodology, which emphasizes flexibility, iterative development, and quick response to changes. As an IoT sensor system, it integrates physical sensors (in this case, the soil moisture sensor) with digital components (the Raspberry Pi) to collect and process data.​​Platform​​: Raspberry Pi. A popular single - board computer known for its affordability, versatility, and wide range of applications in the field of DIY electronics and IoT projects. It provides the computing power and connectivity required to run the Python code and interface with the sensor.​​Sensor​​: Digital Soil Moisture Sensor. This sensor is used to measure the moisture content in the soil. It typically outputs a digital signal that can be easily read by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, allowing the system to determine whether the soil is too dry, too wet, or at an optimal moisture level.​​Output​​: Email alerts via SMTP. The system is configured to send email notifications through the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). These emails can be sent to the user's inbox, providing real - time or scheduled updates on the soil moisture status of their plants.​​Development​​: Managed via Scrum + Sprint + Burndown chart. Scrum is an agile framework for managing and completing complex projects. Sprints are short, time - boxed periods during which a specific set of work is completed. The burndown chart is a visual tool used in Scrum to track the progress of work over time, showing the remaining work against time. This development approach helps ensure that the project stays on schedule and that any issues are addressed promptly.
